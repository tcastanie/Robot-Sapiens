      <h2>Required software</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>MadKit itself is written in 100% pure Java, so you will need a properly installed 
    Java Virtual Machine. We have tested MadKit with the java virtual machine 
    provided by <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun</a></p>
  <p>MadKit 4 requires a Java 2 1.4 JVM (or above) to work properly. Some parts 
    may work with 1.3, but we now use JDK 1.4 to test MadKit.</p>
  <p>MadKit has been tested on the following platforms: Windows (98/2000/XP/NT), 
    Linux (x86/PC) and MacOS X. (beware: the integration is not complete on the 
    Mac. For instance cut/copy/paste still uses the ctrl-x/c/V keys and not the 
    cmd-x/c/v keys as other softwares on the Mac, this will be done in future 
    releases).</p>
  <p>We will suppose that you have installed a Java 2 development environment. 
    You can verify your Java version in a shell with the <tt>-version</tt> command-line 
    option: </p>
  <table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre class="screen"><b><tt>java -version</tt></b>
java version "1.4.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.0-b92)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.0-b92, mixed mode)
</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

    
<p>If you plan to develop agents, for the moment you will certainly need to install 
  the Apache Ant Java-based build tool. You will need the version 1.6.0 of Ant 
  (or above) to develop java agents with MadKit.</p>
<p>Download a MadKit archive and start the install process by typing the following 
  command at a terminal (or shell) prompt:</p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="542">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre class="synopsis"><tt>$</tt> java -jar madkitinstall.jar</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
<p>At the last screen, you may choose the plugins that you want to have installed 
  in MadKit:</p>
<p><img src="images/install_plugins.png"></p>
<p> You do not need to install all the plugins of MadKit. You may install any 
  number of plugins that you may need for your application. If you click on only 
  one plugin, all the files needed to make this plugin work will be automatically 
  installed, so you don't need to know the dependencies between plugins.</p>

      <h2 class="title"> Installing the Jess archive</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p> To work properly, agents of the <tt>JessAgent</tt> class need a specific 
    library, called <tt>jess.jar</tt>. Due to the special License of Jess, it 
    is not possible for MadKit to distribute this library. You must get the jar 
    archive directly from <a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess" target="_top">Sandia</a> 
    the owner of Jess.</p>
  <p>First, go to the <a href="http://herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/download.htm" target="_top">Sandia 
    download area</a>, download the jar corresponding to Jess 6.0 or above, rename 
    it to <code>jess.jar</code> and put it in the <tt>libs/support</tt> directory, 
    overwriting the old <tt>jess.jar</tt>. Then start again MadKit. The new Jess 
    archive will be taken into account directly.</p>
  <p>You may still use MadKit without Jess. Everything, but instances of <tt>JessAgent</tt> 
    and the <tt>JessEditAgent</tt> work fine wihout having the Jess archive installed. 
  </p>
  <p>We are very sorry for this inconvenience, Jess is a good product, but its 
    license is terrible. We are looking for a good free replacement of Jess. Any 
    information about such a product would be appreciated.</p>
  <p><span class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span> if you have any trouble installing 
    Jess on MadKit, contact <tt>&lt;<a href="mailto:ferber@madkit.org">ferber@madkit.org</a>&gt;</tt></p>

  <p> Due to its modular and micro-kernel based architecture, it is possible to 
    start MadKit in several ways: 
  <div class="itemizedlist">

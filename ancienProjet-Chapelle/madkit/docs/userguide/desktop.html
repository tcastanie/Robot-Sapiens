<h1>The MadKit Desktop environment</h1>
<p>The Madkit Destkop environment or desktop for short, is the standard platform 
  GUI for execution and development of agents within MadKit and a good way to 
  start with MadKit. We will see in the <a href="#host" title="5. MadKit host containers"> 
  section about host containers</a> that this is not the only execution environment 
  for MadKit (actually, you can design your owns as needed)</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: the Desktop has been completely modified from version 3.1 to version 
  4.0.</p>
<h4>Convention</h4>
<p>When a menu item selection is being described, the menu is listed first, followed 
  by the menu item itself. The menu is separated from the menu item by greater-than 
  symbols (&#8220;&gt;&#8221;). For example, <b>Windows</b>&gt;<b>add layer</b> 
  refers to the <b>add layer </b> command contained in the <b>Windows</b> menu. 
</p>
<h2>Starting the desktop</h2>
<p>To start the desktop, double click on the file called desktop.bat or desktop.sh, 
  depending on your system, in the bin directory. If the installer set up an icon 
  on your Windows of KDE environment, double click on this icon.</p>

          which may be launched by clicking on the menu items. This menu contains 
          a set of pre-defined agents which may be launched with a single click. 
          It is possible to modify these toolbars at startup. See the section 
          configuring the MadKit menu to learn how to configure this menu. The 
          MadKit menu also contains a set of commands which are used to exit from

        The explorer displays the structure and content of directories. Double-clicking 
        on one of the icons will start the corresponding application. For instance, 
        clicking on .txt file will open the notepad or the corresponding editor, 
        if you have changed the association. Double clicking on agent icons will 
        launch the corresponding agent, whether it is written in Java or in any 
        scripting language. Java jar files containing agents are represented as 
        directories where leaves are the corresponding agents. See <a href="../../plugins/explorer/docs/index.html" title="3.4.2. Using the directory explorer">Using

  <p> To launch an agent you have several possibilities: 
  <div class="itemizedlist"> 
    <ul type="disc">
      <li> 
        <p>Click on one of the menu items of the MadKit main menu</p>

      <li> 
        <p>Double click on one of the agents of the MadKit explorer. If the icons 
          represents a Java agent, then this classe is instantiated and the Java 
          agent launched. If this agent is represented as a script file, i.e. 
          as a .scm (Scheme agents), .py (Python agents), .clp (Jess agents), 
          .bsh (BeanShell agents), then a corresponding agent is launched (e.g. 
          if the file is a .scm file, then a SchemeAgent is launched) with this 
          script as argument. </p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p>Open one of the language editor used for scripted agents (i.e. PythonEditor 
          for Python scripts) and from this editor open a script and evaluate 
          it. See {{link}} to learn how to use the languages editors. </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>There are several tools to observe agents. One of the main tools is the <b>GroupObserver</b>{{link}}, 
    an agent which shows the structure of groups, displays messages between agents, 
    and lists organizational events (playing a role, entering or leaving a group, 
    creating a group, etc.).</p>

      <p><b>Figure 2. Launching a PingPongJava agent</b></p>
      <p> The PingPong agent creates a <tt>ping-pong</tt> group, requests and 
        obtains a <tt>player</tt> role, and then waits for another agent with 
        the same <tt>player</tt> role in the group to exchange a few messages 
        (seen as "balls") with it. You will get the following picture: </p>

      <p>It is possible to view the general organization (i.e. groups, roles and 
        communities), messages and organizational events (i.e. creation of groups, 
        adhesion of an agent to a group, etc.) with a <b>GroupObserver</b>. This 
        tool is actually an agent which is able to display what happens in Madkit 
        from an organizational point of view. To launch the <tt>GroupObserver</tt> 
        click on the icon: <img src="images/groupObserver.gif"></p>

      <p><b>Figure 4. A GroupObserver with a PingPong agent</b></p>
		
      <p>It is possible to see that the PingPong agent plays the role <tt>player</tt> 
        in the group <tt>ping-pong</tt>. One can notice also that there are already 
        several groups which are not part of the application. For instance, the 
        groups <tt>communications</tt> and <tt>system</tt> are parts of MadKit 
        and are used to manage the platform.</p>
      <p>To actually see a trace of the messages sent by agents, click on the 
        <b>show messages</b> button of the <b>Observer</b> agent.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Launch another PingPong java by double clicking on the <code>PingPong 
        agent</code> menu item again. You will see that the two agents (here called 
        <code>PingPong-7</code> and <code>PingPong-8</code>) starts communicating. 
        The <tt>GroupObserver</tt> {{link}} lists all messages that are transmitted 
        between these two agents.

      <p>Scripted agents (i.e. agents whose behavior is written in a script language 
        such as Scheme, Jess, Python or BeanShell) may be launched in exactly 
        the same way as Java based agents. For instance, the following figure 
        shows two PingPong agents. The first one is a Java based agent (as before), 
        and the second one has been written in Python. {{to be finished}} </p>

      <p>When an agent use a heavyweight AWT component (i.e. native platform components), 
        the desktop will launch the agent as an external window, because heavyweight 
        components do not mix well with Swing lightweight components. Please see 
        the Java documentation for more information. </p>

    <p>By default, the desktop will remove the graphical interface of agent when 
      an agent is killed. You can modify this behavior, and leave the graphical 
      interface of agents after the death of agents by unchecking th <b>Dispose 
      GUI at deactivation</b> item in the <b>View</b> menu. </p>
    <p>Note that closing manually an agent interface (by hitting the close box) 
      will dispose the agent GUI <span class="emphasis"><i>and</i></span> kill 
      the agent, thus removing it from the MadKit kernel.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p> jEdit is powerful text editor which is provided free with a GPL Licence. 
    One of the key feature of jEdit is the facility to add plugins and supplement 
    jEdit with new features. </p>
  <p> jEdit has been integrated into MadKit in order to bring the power of a complete 
    editor. With jEdit, it is possible to edit a script of an agent, launch a 
    scripted agent, evaluate Scheme expressions. In the future, more facilities 
    will be added, like developping Java agents without requiring to stop and 
    rerun MadKit. </p>

      <h3 class="title">Caution</h3>
      <p>For the moment, you cannot quit jEdit without leaving MadKit too. Thus 
        once jEdit is launched, you cannot 'delete' jEdit. This is due to some 
        initialization problems. This problem will be solved in a future version 
        of MadKit. </p>

    <p> BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with object 
      scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell executes standard 
      Java statements and expressions, in addition to obvious scripting commands 
      and syntax. BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method closures 
      like those in Perl and JavaScript."(Pat Niemeyer) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Because BeanShell is tightly integrated to Java, it is possible to easily 
    script agent's behavior, create and launch agents without going into the time 
    consuming write-compile-test loop of Java. With BeanShell, as with other scripting 
    languages of MadKit, you write an agent behavior and instantiate it in a snap. 
    But, for Java developpers, an important feature of BeanShell comes from its 
    syntax which is quite similar to Java. Thus, you don't spend time to learn 
    the language and you may focus on the main task of writing agents. </p>
  <p>This document will focus on how to use BeanShell to write an agent's behavior 
    and build scripts. To get a better understanding of BeanShell, please consult 
    the <a href="http://www.beanshell.org" target="_top">official BeanShell site</a>.
